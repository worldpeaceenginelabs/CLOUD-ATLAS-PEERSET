# Peerset

**Short Description:**  
A decentralized peer-to-peer record synchronization system, on top of https://github.com/dmotz/trystero where every record is signed, hashed, moderated, locally stored and synchronized across connected peers. Users can log in with Bech32 keys (Nostr npub/nsec), create records, and participate in a fully self moderated swarm with automatic deduplication, missing-range detection, and session enforcement.

## Get Your Keys
Only you have the Nostr keys in possession but this service offers their recovery via your email address for free: [NSTART.ME](https://nstart.me/)

# Workflow

1. **Peer joins**  
   - Send local bucket hashes to the new peer.

2. **Compare bucket hashes**  
   - Detect which buckets differ between peers.

3. **Send UUIDs**  
   - For differing buckets, send the UUIDs of local records.

4. **Request missing full records**  
   - Receive missing records and update:
     - `recordStore` (in-memory)
     - `uuidStore` (UUID mapping per bucket)
     - IndexedDB (persistent storage)

5. **Update bucket hashes periodically**  
   - Idle peers trigger hash recomputation.
   - Broadcast updated bucket hashes if changes are detected.

6. **Prune old records**  
   - Automatically delete records older than 90 days.

## Granularity

- Buckets are **daily** by default (`day1`, `day2`, â€¦).  
- Can be adjusted to **quarter-day, hourly, or any custom interval** by modifying:
  - `getBucketForDate()`
  - `TOTAL_BUCKETS`
- Smaller intervals increase sync granularity but also metadata size and action frequency.

# Features

- Decentralized peer-to-peer network using Trystero: A hash of the room name is announced on the public BitTorrent tracker network. Everyone interested in that UUID gets connected into a shared WebRTC buffer (our Trystero room)
- Record creation with UUID, timestamp, creator key, geolocation, text, link, hash, and signature
- Automatic SHA-256 hashing and secp256k1 signing of records
- Bucket-based missing-range detection with granularity setting (day/quarterday/...) for efficient syncing of large record sets 
- Full record deduplication and IndexedDB persistence
- Broadcast and request missing records automatically among peers

## Coming soon...
- User login via Bech32 npub/nsec keys (secp256k1) (ready, implementation soon)
- Handshake + Nonce Challenge authentication for secure peer connections (ready, implementation soon)
- Session enforcement: handshake timeout, challenge timeout, max peer & client session times and many more (ready, implementation soon)
- Strict state machine for peer handshake and session management (ready, implementation soon)
- Moderation & strike system: bad-word detection, content/link verification, max 5 records per user, duplicate detection, garbage collection (ready, implementation soon)
- Network UI (maybe web UI): Client Status, Swarm Status, Record Status, settings like timeouts, constants, and types. (coming)
